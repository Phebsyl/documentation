title: About npm CLI versions
slug: /about-npm-versions

The npm command line interface (CLI) is released on a regular cadence. We recommend installing the release that supports your workflow:

- [latest release](#the-latest-release-of-npm): the most recent stable version.

## The `latest` release of npm

The `latest` release of npm is the most recent stable version. When you install Node.js, npm is automatically installed. However, npm is released more frequently than Node.js, so to install the latest stable version of npm, on the command line, run:

```
npm install npm@latest -g
```
